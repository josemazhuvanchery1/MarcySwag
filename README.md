# MarcySwag 
> A marketplace for Marcy Lab students and its supporters to show out in their Marcy Lab swag!

## Sub-Heading 
> MarcySwag is a website directed for Marcy Lab students and its supporters to purchase merch that directly funds the educational opportunities of software engineers on their way to change the face of the tech-world.

## Summary 
> This website hosts a variety of clothing that has the Marcy Lab touch and logo to show out in support (and style :wink:) for the Marcy Lab. All proceeds go towards funding the education and career readiness of the students of Marcy Lab. Students who want to pursue software engineering but found that the traditional pathway wasn't for them enrolled in the Marcy Lab program and are our trailblazers. Help out today by purchasing a crewneck for you, your mother, and a friend! 

## Problem 
> As a non-profit, the Marcy Lab school benefits greatly from partnerships and contributions, it directly funds the education of our software engineers. To continue our mission of changing the landscape of tech and the pathway to it, we want your help and with your contribution you give one more person the opportunity of a lifetime.

## Solution
> Buying and wearing our merch helps Marcy lab gain exposure and the funds directly go towards the allocated budget per student which allows students to focus on their education with the right materials and without worry. As a non-profit, we take no money from our students and instead, we offer a stipend so they can focus entirely on job applications and readiness. As our program grows so does our budget and to continue this we could do with your contribution!

## Key Technical Challenge 
> Handling payments of the product[s] listed is something we think will prove itself to be a challenge.

## Extension Opportunities 
> Additional opportunities to expand the scope of the project are filtering the search results and adding a mailing list option for users.
